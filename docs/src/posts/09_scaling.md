As the Digital Library of Integral Ecology grows, so do the challenges of processing, tagging, and organizing its multilingual reports and academic papers. What works for a dozen documents quickly becomes insufficient at hundreds or thousands.

In this post, we introduce key concepts and tools to **scale the pipeline we've built**, from extracting text and tagging entities to storing relationships in a knowledge graph. We’ll walk through how to introduce **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipelines and scalable infrastructure to support **real-world, high-volume processing**.

---

## What is ETL?

ETL stands for:

* **Extract**: Load data from source (PDFs, metadata, external databases)
* **Transform**: Clean, tag, and enrich with NLP (NER, language detection, taxonomic linking)
* **Load**: Store structured output into a database or knowledge graph (e.g., Neo4j)

This separation of concerns helps you:

* Track and retry failed documents
* Modularize steps (e.g., swap out NER models)
* Scale each stage independently (more extractors, more model containers, etc.)

---

## The Current Stack

So far, this project uses:

* `make pipeline` to run all processing on local files
* Docker Compose to isolate workers and services
* spaCy + TaxoNERD to tag entities
* Neo4j for the knowledge graph
* Doccano for annotation and model refinement

This is perfect for prototyping — but it runs **serially** and assumes a **single machine**.

## Scaling Up: Concepts and Tools

Let's look at where we can go from here. 

### 1. Batch or Parallel Processing

Instead of one big loop, we can break processing into chunks:

* Each PDF or .txt becomes a job
* Use queues (like [**Redis**](https://redis.io/), [**RabbitMQ**](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), or [**Kafka**](https://kafka.apache.org/)) to dispatch tasks
* Workers (running in Docker or Kubernetes) pull and process jobs independently

This means you can scale from 1 to 100 workers with minimal code changes.

### 2. ETL Orchestration with Airflow or Prefect

[**Apache Airflow**](https://airflow.apache.org/) or [**Prefect**](https://www.prefect.io/) can:

Define data pipelines as Python DAGs (directed acyclic graphs)

* Track failures, retries, and run history
* Schedule jobs (e.g., run daily, every hour, or on new upload)

You define a pipeline as a DAG:

```python
with DAG("extract_entities", schedule_interval="@hourly") as dag:
    extract = PythonOperator(...)
    detect_lang = PythonOperator(...)
    run_spacy = PythonOperator(...)
    push_to_graph = PythonOperator(...)
```

### 3. Use Object Storage for Large Files

Instead of keeping files on disk:

* Store `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.jsonl` in **Amazon S3** (or [**MinIO**](https://min.io/) for self-hosted)
* Tag files with metadata (e.g., language, processed status)
* Stream files into your workers as needed

This makes your pipeline **stateless** and easier to scale.

## Scaling Model Inference

As we add more complex NER models (like `en_ner_eco_biobert`), inference gets slower. To deal with this we can:

* Host models with [**FastAPI**](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) as REST or GraphQL endpoints
* Use **transformers pipelines** with [**TorchServe**](https://docs.pytorch.org/serve/) or [**Hugging Face Inference Endpoints**](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints/dedicated)
* Use **GPU-backed instances** for model inference

You can wrap spaCy models into a microservice like:

```python
@app.post("/ner")
def tag(text: str):
    doc = nlp(text)
    return [{"text": ent.text, "label": ent.label_} for ent in doc.ents]
```

## Knowledge Graph Growth

As our Neo4j graph grows, how this piece is handled needs to also grow:

* Move to [**Neo4j AuraDB**](https://neo4j.com/product/auradb/) or [**Neo4j Enterprise**](https://neo4j.com/licensing/) for performance and backups
* Consider [**TigerGraph**](https://www.tigergraph.com/) or [**TerminusDB**](https://terminusdb.org/) for high-volume or time-series data
* Use [**Cypher**](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/) or [**GraphQL**](https://graphql.org/) to query and visualize ecological relationships

---

## Distributed Training & Annotation

As our labeled data grows:

* Run training jobs via **Airflow** or a **Makefile**
* Distribute annotation tasks with Doccano’s multi-user support
* Consider [**Hugging Face AutoTrain**](https://huggingface.co/autotrain), [**Prodi.gy**](https://prodi.gy/), or [**Label Studio**](https://labelstud.io/) for advanced workflows.

---

## Monitoring and Fault Tolerance

* Use [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/) + [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/) to monitor throughput and failures
* Log processing status in [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* Alert when documents fail or get stuck

---

## Scaling for Ecological Impact

Integral ecology is inherently **global and multilingual**. By scaling your knowledge graph infrastructure, we can enable powerful tools:

* Track biodiversity loss across regions and languages
* Compare ecological concepts in UN reports and academic literature
* Enable public tools for data exploration and learning
